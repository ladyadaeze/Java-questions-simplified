Q1. Write a program which displays the sum of the strict divisors of an integer given by the user



Answer: 

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in)

System.out.print("Enter a number: ");
int n = scan.nextInt();

int sum = 0;
for (int i = 1; i <= n/2; i++) {
if(n % i == 0) 
sum += i; 
//System.out.print(" " + i);
System.out.print(sum);


This is not the explanation. This is breaking down the question:

1.	The strict divisors of any number is ‘N less than or equal that number divided by 2.’
2.	N <= N/2
3.	If the user enters 6. The strict divisors of 6 are 1+ 2 + 3.
4.	1 + 2 + 3 are the divisors without the number itself.
5.	The sum of these numbers is 6.
6.	This programme should calculate the sum of the strict divisors and display it.
7.	If the user enters 10. The sum of the strict divisors is 1 + 2 + 5 = 8.
8.	Always remember that an integer divisor is: N <= N/2 
9.	This means that even If the number given is ‘15’ (which is 15/2 = 7.5)
10.	The computer will only accept 7 as it’s an Integer division not a double or a float.
11.	Another key point to know: if you see N % i = 0 
12.	‘i’ is a divisor of N.
13.	You need to iterate [repeat the function of] over all possible divisors [1 till you get to n/2] 
14.	In each iteration, you are going to test this:
15.	 if ‘i’ is a divisor of ‘n’, add ‘i’ to the variable sum
16.	Sum += i %10


Rationale:

1.	Get the number from the user and assign it to the variable n.

System.out.print(“Enter a number: ”);
Int n = scan.nextInt();

2.	Iterate all the possible divisors for this number
3.	Use a ‘For’ loop because you need a variable ‘i’ .
for (int i = 1; I <= n/2; i++);

4.	Start ‘i’ from 1
5.	Run the loop as long as ‘i’ is less than or equal to n/2
6.	Then increment ‘i’
7.	In each iteration, you want to test if I is advisor of n.

If(n % i == 0)

8.	If n modulo ‘i’ is equal to 0, this means ‘i’ is a divisor of n.
9.	Add ‘i’ to a variable ‘sum’.
10.	Declare the variable ‘sum’ above the for loop.

int sum = 0;
11.	Add to the variable sum, variable i

sum += i;

12.	Because ‘i’ is a divisor of the variable n as this condition If(n % i == 0) is true.
13.	System.out.println(sum);






If you still don’t know what is going on:

1.	To find the divisor of 12, factorise
12 = 4 * 3
12 = 2 * 2 * 3
          12 = 22    x   31

2.	Use the powers and add one each time 

2+1=3
1+1=2

3.	Multiply the answer

3*2=6

4.	This is how many numbers of divisors there are for 12.
5.	There are 6 divisors of 12
6.	Remember the number of divisor is no more than n/2
7.	That means the divisors are no more than 6.
8.	Find all the multiples of 12 than range from 1 – 6

3 x 4 = 12
6 x 2 = 12

9.	Therefore the divisors of 12 are: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 6
10.	The sum of these divisors are:16
11.	1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 6 = 16
