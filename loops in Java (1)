Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);
/* To print this with an input from the user

 This is the code needed:
 
 System.out.println("Enter a number: ")
 int n = scan.nextInt();
 
 for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
 	for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++){
	
System.out.println("*");
System.out.println();
	}
}

To print this :

This is the code needed. Here's a step by step explaination:
	
*/
		
		/* You want to print a line of stars if you're in the 1st line or last line.
		 * You have to execute this loop  below if you're in the first line or last line.
		 * 
		 * for(int i = 1; i <= n; i++){
			  System.out.print("*");
		 * 
		 * 1. You are printing 'n' lines
		 * 2. In each iteration, you will check if you are in the 1st line (i == 1) or last line (i == n)
		 * 3. If this is true, you are going to print a line of stars.[ for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++) System.out.print("*");]
		   4. If this is not true, you're going to print 'n' things.  [for(int j = 1; j <= n; j++)]
		 * 5. The 1st thing and the last thing will be a star ("*") 
		 * if(i == 1 || i == n) System.out.print("*");
		 * and all the other things will be spaces (" ")
		 * else System.out.print(" ");
