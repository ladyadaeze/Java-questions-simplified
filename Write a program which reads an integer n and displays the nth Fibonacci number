Q1. Write a program which reads an integer n and displays the nth Fibonacci number.
Answer: 

Scanner scan = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out.print(“Enter a positive integer n: ”);
int n = scan.nextInt();

int result = 0;
int v1 = 1;
int v2 = 1;
for(int i = 1; i <= n-2; i++){
result = v1 + v2;
v1 = v2;
v2 = result;

}
System.out.println(“result = ” + result);



This is not the explanation. 
This is breaking down the question:


 Q1. What is the Fibonacci sequence?

Answer: This is a sequence of numbers where the first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1.
Then, each additional Fibonacci number is the sum of two previous numbers in the sequence:

1,1,2,3,5,8,13,21....


To get the nth Fibonacci number we need n-2steps

Rationale:

1.	Store inside a variable called ‘n’
2.	To run n-2 iterations, I  should be less than or equal to n-2
3.	Increment I by 1
